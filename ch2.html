<h2 id="data-transmission">Data Transmission</h2>
<h3 id="simplex-half-duplex-and-full-duplex">Simplex, half-duplex and full-duplex</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Simplex Data Transmission</strong>: One direction only.</li>
<li><strong>Half-duplex Data Transmission</strong>: Both directions but not at the same time.</li>
<li><strong>Full-duplex Data Transmission</strong>: Both directions simultaneously.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="serial-and-parallel-data-transmission">Serial and parallel data transmission</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Serial Data Transmission</strong>
<ul>
<li>Data is sent, one bit at a time, over a single wire or channel.</li>
<li>Works well over long distances.</li>
<li>Data will not be out of synchronisation.</li>
<li>Relatively slow.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Parallel Data Transmission</strong>
<ul>
<li>Several bits of data are sent down several wires or channels at the same time. Each wire or channel is used to transmit each bit.</li>
<li>Works well over short distances.</li>
<li>Relatively fast.</li>
<li>Bits can become ‘skewed’ and out of synchronisation.</li>
<li>Eg. Computer-printer ribbon connector.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="asynchronous-and-synchronous-data-transmission">Asynchronous and synchronous data transmission</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Asynchronous data transmission</strong>
<ul>
<li>Data is transmitted in an agreed bit pattern.</li>
<li>Data bits are grouped together and sent with control bits, to indicate when the data starts and when it ends.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Synchronous data transmission</strong>
<ul>
<li>A continuous stream of data.</li>
<li>The data is accompanied by timing signals generated by an internal clock.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="universal-serial-bus-usb">Universal Serial Bus (USB)</h3>
<ul>
<li>USB is an asynchronous serial data transmission method. It consists of:
<ol>
<li>A four-wire shielded cable</li>
<li>Two of the wires are used for power and the earth</li>
<li>Two of the wires are used in the data transmission.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>When a device is plugged into a computer using one of the USB ports:
<ol>
<li>The computer detects that a device is present</li>
<li>The device is recognised and the appropriate device driver is loaded up</li>
<li>If a new device is detected, the computer will look for the device driver which matches the device. If this isn’t available, the user is prompted to download the drivers.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="error-checking-methods">Error-checking methods</h2>
<ol>
<li>Parity checking
<ul>
<li>Used to check whether data has been changed or corrupted following transmission from one device or medium to another device or medium.</li>
<li>A byte of data is allocated a parity bit. This is allocated before transmission takes place, to satisfy the system’s parity. Systems that use even parity have an even number of 1-bits, and systems that use odd parity have an odd number of 1-bits.</li>
<li>However, it is not possible to work out the location of error. So, parity bytes are used:
<ul>
<li>Each column of bits have a parity bit allocated to it, which is transmitted at the end.</li>
<li>However, if two of the bits change value following data transmission, it might be impossible to locate the error.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Automatic repeat request (ARQ)
<ul>
<li>An acknowledgement sent by the receiver of the data to the sender of the data indicating whether the data is received correctly.</li>
<li>If this is sent before a specific time limit, timeout occurs, which means that the sender sends the message again.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Checksum
<ul>
<li>Another way to check if data has been changed or corrupted following data transmission.</li>
<li>Data is sent in blocks and an additional value, the checksum, is also sent at the end of the block data.</li>
<li>The checksum can be calculated from the block data and verified against the one send with it.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Echo checking
<ul>
<li>The received data is sent back to the sender. The sender compares the two sets of data to check if any occurred during the transmission process.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<h1 id="internet-technologies">Internet Technologies</h1>
<h2 id="internet-service-provider-isp">Internet Service Provider (ISP)</h2>
<ul>
<li>These are companies that provide users with access to the internet.</li>
<li>Monthly fee is usually charged.</li>
<li>Will set up a user account, with username &amp; password.</li>
<li>Assigns an IP address.</li>
<li>Ensure that certain web domains are blocked as per court orders from the Government.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="internet-protocol-ip-address">Internet Protocol (IP) Address</h2>
<ul>
<li>Each device on the internet is given a unique address known as the internet protocol (IP) address.</li>
<li>Difference between IP and Media Access Control (MAC) addresses:
<ul>
<li>A MAC address identifies the device connected to the internet. The IP address gives the location of a device on the internet, whereas the MAC address identifies the device connected to the internet.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="hyper-text-mark-up-language-html">Hyper text mark-up language (HTML)</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Structure</strong> is the essential part of the HTML document; it includes the semantics and structural mark-up of the document.</li>
<li><strong>Presentation</strong> is the style of the document.</li>
<li>Both of these are kept separate while designing the web page, in the form of HTML and CSS files.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="hypertext-transfer-protocol-http">Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP)</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>HTTP</strong> is a set of rules that must be obeyed when transferring files over the internet.</li>
<li>When some form of security is used, this changes to http<strong>s</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="web-browsers">Web browsers</h2>
<ul>
<li>This is software that displays a webpage on the computer screen.</li>
<li>Translate HTML code and display it on a webpage.</li>
<li>They navigate the web with the use of a URL (uniform resource locator). This is divided into three parts:
<ul>
<li>Protocol: http(s)</li>
<li>Web server’s name: <a href="http://www.servername.com">www.servername.com</a></li>
<li>File name: /index.html</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Features:
<ol>
<li>They have a home page</li>
<li>They store the user’s favourite pages</li>
<li>Record history</li>
<li>Ability to go backward and forward to websites opened.</li>
</ol>
