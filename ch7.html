      <h1 id="programming-languages">Programming Languages</h1>
<ul>
<li>A <strong>computer program</strong> is a list of instructions that enable a computer to perform a specific task.</li>
<li>A program is written in a programming language.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="languages">Languages</h2>
<h3 id="high-level-languages">High-level languages</h3>
<ul>
<li>Designed with programmers in mind</li>
<li>Language used is similar to human language</li>
<li>Problem-oriented</li>
<li>No knowledge of the hardware and instruction set of the computer is needed</li>
<li>Easier to:
<ul>
<li>read and understand</li>
<li>write quickly</li>
<li>debug when in use</li>
<li>maintain when in use</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="low-level-languages">Low-level languages</h3>
<ul>
<li>Relate to the specific architecture and hardware of a particular type of computer.</li>
<li>Types of low-level languages:
<ul>
<li>Assembly languages
<ul>
<li>Few programmers write in this, as the language is very arcane and hard to understand.</li>
<li>An assembler is needed to translate this to machine code.</li>
<li>Programmers write in this for the following reasons:
<ul>
<li>to make use of special hardware</li>
<li>to make use of special machine-dependant instructions</li>
<li>to write code that doesn’t take up space in primary memory</li>
<li>to write code that performs a task very quickly.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Machine code
<ul>
<li>This is a computer programming language consisting of binary or hexadecimal instructions which a computer can respond to directly.</li>
<li>These are executed directly by the computer’s CPU.</li>
<li>This code is in binary, but is usually shown in hexadecimal.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="translators">Translators</h2>
<h3 id="compilers">Compilers</h3>
<ul>
<li>Translates a high-level program to machine code.</li>
<li>An object file is produced, which can then be processed and executed by the computer.</li>
<li>This object file can be executed as many times as needed.</li>
<li>Compiled programs (the object file) can be used without the compiler.</li>
<li>If a program contains a syntax error, a comprehensive list of all syntax errors is produced.</li>
<li>Usually distributed for general use.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="interpreters">Interpreters</h3>
<ul>
<li>Executes a high-level language program one statement at a time.</li>
<li>No executable file of machine code is produced.</li>
<li>Interpreted programs cannot be used without the interpreter.</li>
<li>If the program contains a syntax error, interpreters will stop execution as soon as they encounter the first syntax error.</li>
<li>Often used when a program is being developed.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="assemblers">Assemblers</h3>
<ul>
<li>Translates a low-level language program into machine code.</li>
<li>An executable file of machine code is produced.</li>
<li>One low-level language statement is usually translated into one machine code instruction.</li>
<li>Assembled programs can be used without the assembler.</li>
<li>An assembled program is usually distributed for general use.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="errors">Errors</h2>
<ul>
<li>A <strong>syntax error</strong> is where a program statement does not obey the grammatical rules of the programming language.
<ul>
<li>There are two types of syntax errors:
<ol>
<li>When commands not present in the programming language are used. In English, this would be: <code>”I am the glabglabgugalab"</code>.</li>
<li>When commands present in the programming language are used, but in a way that doesn’t make grammatical sense. For example, in English: <code>“I are inevitable."</code></li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Syntax errors are usually caught by a compiler or interpreter.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>A <strong>logic error</strong> is when a program does not do what it was intended to do.</li>
<li>A <strong>runtime error</strong> is when a program encounters issues with some operations during runtime. For example, a runtime error is produced when a preposterous statement like  <code>”I love you” + 3000</code> is found. This could be due to wrong types of input, for example.</li>
