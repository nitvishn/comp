<p>This is a comprehensive list of computer science notes for the IGCSE Computer Science exam in May/June 2019.</p>
<p>I will not be covering the first chapter named “Binary systems and hexadecimal”, as most of it is simple calculations. I have covered “Uses of hexadecimal”, though.</p>
<p>I will also not be covering Chapter 3: “Logic gates and logic circuits”, as it just teaches skills that you have hopefully picked up already.</p>
<p>I have also left out the redundant parts of the last section about practical problem-solving and programming, condensing all the content into one chapter.</p>
<p>If you do require notes or help in these omitted chapters, please reach out to me.</p>
<p>I hope they’re useful study notes to just look at or revise from. Cross-checked with multiple sources.</p>
